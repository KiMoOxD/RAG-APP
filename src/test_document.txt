This is a test document about Artificial Intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. 
These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience 
without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is a further subset that uses neural networks 
with multiple layers.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is another branch of AI that deals with the interaction 
between computers and humans using natural language. Applications include chatbots, 
translation services, and sentiment analysis.

Computer Vision is the field that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information 
from the world, including images and videos.
